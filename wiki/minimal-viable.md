# Minimal Viable Programs

> A minimal viable program is the smallest program that solves a particular problem. It is small and beautiful. It has no additional features. If you removed a single feature it would be totally useless. If you added a new feature that feature would not be essential, you could use the program without making use of the new feature. Very few of the programs I use are minimal viable programs, but some are. I'll describe one such program.
