# Worse is Better

The principle, as formulated in [The Ducktape Programer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/),  says:

> A 50%-good solution that people actually have solves more problems and survives longer than a 99% solution that nobody has because it’s in your lab where you’re endlessly polishing the damn thing.
