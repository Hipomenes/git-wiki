# Welcome to Zero Growth demo

This is both documentation and [demo](Demo.md) of git-wiki theme for jekyll.

It's a **modular and full featured wiki** powered by git, github pages and pull-requests!

It means: 

* Improvements in the **cooperative** aspect: forks, pull-requests and roles.
* You can **customize your wiki** as you want with style sheets and even changing the layout. (see customization section below) 
* **No databases!** Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.
* **Blazing fast** and free thankfully to Github Pages and Jekyll Server Side Generation process!
* **Markdown and html** mixed together!
This web page is dedicated to finding functional, non-bloated software solutions for common tasks.

You can read more about [degrowth](degrowth.md).
